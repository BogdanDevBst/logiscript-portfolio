# Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

I am a freelance full-stack developer with over five years of experience building modern, scalable applications across web and desktop platforms. My expertise centers on JavaScript and TypeScript development with React, Node.js, and ElectronJS, having successfully led projects from initial prototype through production deployment across diverse industries including e-commerce, green technology, smart vending solutions, and education.

## Professional Experience

My professional journey includes significant experience as a full-time developer with N-and Group Ltd in Italy, where I spearheaded the development of vending software interfaces and advanced to Tech Lead on the IVS UI project. This role involved integrating indoor payment systems into smart vending machines using Electron and React, demonstrating my ability to architect complex desktop applications that bridge hardware and software requirements.

As an independent developer, I specialize in delivering comprehensive solutions that encompass end-to-end web applications built with React and Next.js, cross-platform desktop applications using ElectronJS, robust APIs and dashboards, modern e-commerce platforms, and sophisticated user interfaces crafted with Tailwind CSS and RemixJS. My approach emphasizes performance optimization and maintainable code architecture that scales with business growth.

## Notable Projects and Impact

My project portfolio includes several high-impact applications that demonstrate both technical excellence and measurable business outcomes. The Climate Calculator, developed for prestigious clients including WWF, National Grid, and ScottishPower, showcases my ability to work with major organizations on environmentally focused technology solutions. VenueNow stands as a particularly successful implementation, achieving a reduction of over 150 tons of COâ‚‚ emissions annually for the client while delivering a seamless user experience.

Additional significant contributions include modernizing the MyShine legacy React project through strategic implementation of Tailwind CSS, contributing to ZNotes which serves over six million global learners, and creating Onympo, an innovative smart gym vending interface that leverages Electron and Redux for optimal performance and user interaction.

## Technical Expertise

My technical foundation encompasses a comprehensive modern development stack including React and TypeScript for frontend development, Electron for cross-platform desktop applications, Node.js and NestJS for backend services, PostgreSQL and Firebase for data management, Docker for containerization, and CI/CD pipelines for deployment automation. I also maintain proficiency in Tailwind CSS for responsive design, Vite for build optimization, and Linux system administration.

This diverse technical skill set enables me to approach projects holistically, ensuring seamless integration between frontend interfaces, backend services, and deployment infrastructure while maintaining high standards for code quality and system performance.

## Availability

I am currently available for remote freelance opportunities, particularly projects that require full ownership of the development process, clean architectural design, and a product-focused development mindset. My experience across multiple industries and technical domains positions me to deliver solutions that meet both immediate technical requirements and long-term business objectives.
